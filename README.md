Hallo Im trying to experiment with Screen Capture and YOLOv8. 

The goals is to detect half of my desktop screen without think what files
need to be input, just place whatever on your left screen and it will detect.
Im noticing this app need time to display the image that has been annotated,
because i think it's taking 0,1 sec to save and display.
